Hey 👋

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer focused on Hotwire and Shopify Apps. I build open-source tools for developers to create amazing server-rendered Shopify Apps with Rails and Hotwire.

👨‍💻 I work on the following open-source projects right now:

- [Hotwire Livereload gem](https://github.com/kirillplatonov/hotwire-livereload)
- [Polaris ViewComponents gem](https://github.com/baoagency/polaris_view_components)
- [Shopify Hotwire Sample](https://github.com/kirillplatonov/shopify-hotwire-sample)
- [Shopify Graphql gem](https://github.com/kirillplatonov/shopify_graphql)

✨ You can follow me on Twitter [@kirplatonov](https://twitter.com/kirplatonov).
